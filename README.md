# A perspective of Robotics and LLM/LFM


# ABSTRACT 

In the intricate landscape of human cognition, language is not merely a bridge for communication but a fundamental instrument for thought. This profound connection between language and cognitive processes, illuminated through internal dialogues or "inner speech," underlines the essential role of language in self-reflection and in-depth contemplation. Recently, LLMs have shown remarkable capability in processing and generating human-like language, showcasing potential in mimicking human language processing. However, reaching or surpassing true human-level intelligence is still challenging. These include understanding concepts of time and space, recognizing self-capabilities, engaging in self-reflection and progress, exhibiting subjective agency, continuous learning, and even the development of self-awareness. Powered by these models, LLM agents have been developed with perception and action abilities to deal with more complex tasks. Similar to how humans and other living organisms interact with environment and achieve self-growth, endowing LLMs with the capabilities to interact with environments could be a pathway toward realizing AGI or even SLA (silicon-based life agents). Traditional robotics has achieved remarkable achievements by mimicking this kind of biological mechanisms, offering valuable insights for the evolution of LLM agents. This paper proposes a paradigm shift, distinct from applying LLMs to robotics. It focuses on integrating essential robotics principles into LLM agents, such as sensory perception, planning for dynamic environmental interaction, and real-time adaptive feedback, into the framework of LLM agents. This integration aims to extend the capabilities of LLMs beyond linguistic proficiency, endowing them with a more nuanced understanding of real-world contexts like time, space, energy to enhance their decision-making processes, enable action capabilities, realize self-reflection and growth, pushing LLM agents towards a more comprehensive emulation, and potentially surpassing, human intelligence. However, the transition to silicon-based intelligent entities is not just a technological challenge but also involves profound philosophical and ethical considerations. The development of AGI might redefine the essence and boundaries of intelligence, necessitating cautious contemplation of the technological advancementsâ€™ impacts on society and human values. This interdisciplinary integration aims to advance AGI research while addressing the potential social, ethical, and technical challenges in this evolving field
